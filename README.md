# DS-5110---Big-Data

## Project: Comparing data systems

We will evaluate the execution time, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of each distributed computing system. Specifically, we will measure the speedup achieved when scaling out the cluster considering different types of EC2 VM instances (1-core vs. 2-core) and storage options. Additionally, we will compare the performance of Ray and Dask frameworks with traditional Spark systems across various algorithms such as K-Means and CNN, using the sklearn digit dataset.

With further reccomendation for the professor we will us s3 to upload the data.

The digits.csv is the data from the sklearn digit module that was uploaded to s3.

The .ipynb file is our current working file.

The pdf is a markdown copy of our current working file for better readability.

Please email psa7rm for further clarification.
